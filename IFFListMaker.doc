    IFFListMaker <TO=file> <TYPE=type> [PROP=file] [FROM=file] [file1 ...]

FUNCTION

    IFFListMaker is a tool for creating single IFF LIST file from specified
    IFF FORM files of the same type. Optional PROP chunk for the LIST may be
    created from separate IFF FORM.

    Payload of input FORMs is copied without further parsing. Payload of FORM
    containing desired LIST properties is copied into PROP without further
    parsing too.

INPUTS

    TO - Output IFF LIST file. Required argument.
    TYPE - IFF type of resulting list, as well as rerquired type of input
        FORMs and FORM containing properties. Required argument. Must be valid
        IFF type identifier.
    PROP - Specifies IFF FORM file of matching type. All chunks from inside
        the FORM are copied to PROP chunk of destination. Optional argument.
        If not specified, PROP will not be inserted.
    FROM - Specifies a plain text file containing list of IFF files to be
        merged into LIST, one file per line. Optional argument. If present,
        all input files specified in the rest of command line are ignored.
	FILES - Input files specified as arguments.

NOTES
    Order of merged FORMS is preserved. Order of chunks inside them is preserved
    as well.

    LIST [length] WXYZ
        PROP [length] WXYZ
            <payload of 'y.iff' FORM>
		FORM [length] WXYZ
            <payload of 'a.iff' FORM>
		FORM [lenght] WXYZ
            <payload of 'b.iff' FORM>
